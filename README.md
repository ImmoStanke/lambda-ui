### Getting Started

#### Development
Use the _go_ script to run the necessary build steps:

1. `./go setup` -- Run to update npm dependencies. Only required once.
2. `./go serve-ui` -- Runs a webserver thats serves the frontend on port 8080. Watches the frontend folder for changes and rebundles them on the fly.


Also see `./go help` for further goals.
You can also use the NPM targets when inside the _resources/ui_ folder.
